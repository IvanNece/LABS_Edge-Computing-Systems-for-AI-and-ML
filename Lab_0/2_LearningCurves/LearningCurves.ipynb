All the other variables are potential features, and the values for each are actually hourly averages (not net values, like for PE). The electricity is generated by gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators. According to the documentation of the data set, the vacuum level has an effect on steam turbines, while the other three variables affect the gas turbines. Consequently, we will use all of the feature columns in our regression models. At this step we would normally put aside a test set, explore the training data thoroughly, remove any outliers, measure correlations, etc. For this lab's purposes, however, we will assume that’s already done and jump straight to generate some learning curves. Before we start that, it is worth noticing that there are no missing values (i.e. the data have already been \"cleaned\" for us). Also, the numbers are unscaled, but they are not too far apart, so we should not have too many problems without scaling. We will cover scaling (subtracting mean, dividing by std) in later labs.\n",

In our case, `cv = 5`, so there will be five splits. For each split, an estimator is trained for every training set size specified.\n",

        "1. For 1 training datum, the training error is 0, because a straight line can fit exactly any 1- or 2-point dataset. Of course the validation error is huge, because with just 1 datum we cannot even guess correctly the 5 parameters of our model (4 weights and one bias). Hence this part of the lerning curve will not be realistic, but it will give us an idea of what happens when we have too few data to learn all the parametrs of the model.\n",
        "2. With larger and larger dataset variance goes down, and that is a **good indication that above roughly 100 samples we have included enough data to properly train our model**.\n",
        "3. **The training and validation error curves converge**, and that means again that **we are not experiencing overfitting**, i.e. we do not see too little variance in the training data with respect to the large variance of the \"true population\" (represented by the validation set).\n",
        "4. The final mean squared errors are fairly low (the square root of 20 is about 4.5, while the mean value of PE is about 450, hence we are about 1% off the true prediction).\n",
        "5. The values of columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the training error the smaller datasets are identical, e.g. (your actual values may be different, due to different random number generator seeds):\n",

        "This should give you an idea of what a modern tensor-oriented programming language such as numpy, matlab or R, offers. In this case we could simply have appended the `train_sizes` array to the `train_scores_mean` array, and printed pretty much the same result. But, as you know, a dictionary is much more powerful than an array. We will not exploit it further here, but you can find it useful later."
